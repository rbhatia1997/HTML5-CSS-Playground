# HTML5-CSS-Playground

Repository and sample code to illustrate how to work with HTML5 and CSS.

# Notes on Web Development

- Javascript adds functionality, CSS provides the style, and HTML are the building blocks.

## How does the Web Work?

The address in the browser is the uniform resource locator (URL). It's how we locate internet resources. When we hit enter, there are two pieces: (1) Browser/client and (2) Server (computers that host the target website). This is a client-server model.

Any information is based on the protocol HTTP: hypertext transfer protocol. The communication starts with a request and ends with a response. As a browser reads HTML, it constructs a DOM (document object model). Represents the objects/elements in the HTML document. Resources have an address or URL and for each resource, a seperate request is generated.

## Looking for Validation?

There are ways to validate your website for both CSS and HTML.

- For HTML, one way is to go to the following [link](https://validator.w3.org/). You can validate via file upload as well as by putting in a URL.
- For CSS, you can validate by going to the following [link](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator).
